title: "Ultrafast rogue wave patterns in fiber lasers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Ultrafast
excerpt: Fiber lasers are convenient for studying extreme and rare events, such as rogue waves, thanks to the lasersâ€™ fast dynamics. Indeed, several types of rogue wave patterns were observed in fiber lasers at different time-scales: single peak, twin peak, and triple peak. 
We measured the statistics of these ultrafast rogue wave patterns with a time lens and developed a numerical model proving that the patterns of the ultrafast rogue waves were generated by the non-instantaneous relaxation of the saturable absorber together with the polarization mode dispersion of the cavity. 
Our results indicate that the dynamics of the saturable absorber is directly related to the dynamics of ultrafast extreme events in lasers.
