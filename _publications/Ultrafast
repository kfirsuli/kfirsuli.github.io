title: "Ultrafast rogue wave patterns in fiber lasers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Ultrafast
excerpt: We measured the statistics of ultrafast rogue wave patterns with a time lens and developed a numerical model proving that the patterns of the ultrafast rogue waves were generated by the non-instantaneous relaxation of the saturable absorber together with the polarization mode dispersion of the cavity.
