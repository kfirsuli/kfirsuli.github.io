permalink: /publication/Soliton_pairs
excerpt: We study experimentally and theoretically the steady states of two-soliton waveforms that form stationary bound states in a fiber laser, passively mode locked by a nonlinear-multimode-interference-based saturable absorber. We control the steady state separation by changing the laser parameters, and in particular demonstrate a dynamical transition between loosely-bound states where the solitons interact via the noise-mediated Casimir-like interactions, and tightly-bound states dominated by coherent overlap interactions. We show that the measured pulse separations of the loosely bound pairs are well-described by the NMI theory, and present a steady state phase diagram that captures the transitions between the loosely- and tightly-bound states as an intrinsic consequence of the form of the noise-mediated interaction effective potential.
