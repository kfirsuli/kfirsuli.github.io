title: "Bound Solitons Induced by Noise-Mediated Casimir-Like Interactions"

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We study experimentally and theoretically the steady states of optical solitons that aggregate into bunches in a nonlinear multimode interference based mode-locked fiber laser. By modifying the laser gain via its pumping current, we demonstrate a variety of steady states. We model the steady states using our recently proposed noise-mediated Casimir-like pulse interaction mechanism and obtain a quantitative agreement with our experimental results. We present a steady states phase diagram and demonstrate transitions between noise-mediated and coherently bound states without using additional modulators, asserting the noise-mediated interaction as a dominant mechanism in the complex soliton structures. The control of the complex soliton structures via the pumping current opens the door for the use of ultrafast lasers in telecommunication. '
