collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Reconfigurable
excerpt: Efficient processing of high-dimensional entangled photons requires the ability to synthesize their state using general unitary transformations. Here we demonstrate a reconfigurable processor of entangled photons that is based on multi-plane light conversion, a technology that was recently developed for multiplexing hundreds of spatial modes for classical free-space and fiber communication. To demonstrate the flexibility of MPLC, we perform four key tasks of quantum information processing using the same MPLC hardware: entanglement certification, tailored two-photon interference, arbitrary state transformations, and mode conversion.
