abstract: "We present a multi-agent system for automatically proving theorems in Lean across diverse scientific domains. The framework combines LLMs with Lean tools via the Model Context Protocol to ensure formal correctness. On public math benchmarks Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers, while substantially outperforming them on new domain-specific benchmarks in abstract algebra and quantum theory."
