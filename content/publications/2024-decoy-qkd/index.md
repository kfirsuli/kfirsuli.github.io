abstract: "The original proposal of quantum key distribution (QKD) was based on ideal single photon sources, which 40 years later, are still challenging to develop. Therefore, the development of decoy state protocols using weak coherent states (WCS) from lasers, set the frontier in terms of secure key rates and distances. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two simple-to-implement QKD protocols that allow practical, far from ideal sub-Poissonian photon sources to outperform state-of-the-art WCS. By engineering the photon statistics of a biexciton-exciton cascade in room temperature single photon sources based on giant colloidal quantum dots coupled to nanoantennas, we show that either a truncated decoy state protocol or a heralded purification protocol can be employed to achieve a significantly increased performance in terms of the maximal allowed channel loss for secure key creation, which can exceed even that of ideal WCS by more than 3dB."
