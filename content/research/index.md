        My research sits at the intersection of **quantum optics**, **photonics**, **machine learning**, and **information security**. I develop new quantum and optical technologies — from fundamental physics to practical systems — with a focus on four interconnected pillars.

        <h2 id="quantum-photonics">Quantum Photonics & Communication</h2>

        Quantum communication harnesses the fundamental laws of physics to enable provably secure information transfer. My work advances the field by developing **high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD)** protocols that encode information in multiple degrees of freedom of single photons — spatial modes, time bins, and orbital angular momentum.

        Key contributions include:
        - **High-dimensional coherent one-way QKD**: A protocol that doubles secret key rates compared to standard binary encoding, using only commercial off-the-shelf hardware. Demonstrated over 40 km of standard fiber — upgradeable via software alone.
        - **Multimode fiber-based entangled photon sources**: All-fiber generation and sorting of spatially correlated photon pairs, enabling scalable quantum networks.
        - **Programmable entanglement processing**: Using multi-plane light converters to reconfigurably manipulate high-dimensional entangled states for quantum information tasks.
        - **QKD with quantum dots**: Orbital angular momentum-based high-dimensional QKD using room-temperature single-photon sources.

        <h2 id="quantum-secure-ai">Quantum-Secure AI</h2>

        As deep learning moves to the cloud, protecting sensitive data during computation becomes critical. I pioneered a new approach that uses **quantum mechanics to provide information-theoretic security** for multiparty deep learning — guaranteeing security not by computational hardness assumptions, but by the laws of physics.

        Our protocol enables multiple parties to collaboratively perform deep neural network inference without revealing their private data to each other or to the server. This work was published in **Physical Review X (2025)** and received widespread media coverage from [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-security-protocol-shields-data-during-cloud-based-computation-0926), [Tech Briefs](https://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/52065-new-security-protocol-protects-cloud-based-server-data), ScienceDaily, Phys.org, and SciTechDaily.

        <h2 id="nonlinear-fiber-optics">Nonlinear Fiber Optics</h2>

        Ultrafast fiber lasers produce complex multi-pulse dynamics that serve as a rich playground for nonlinear physics. My research uncovered **noise-mediated Casimir-like interactions** between optical solitons — a long-range force analogous to the quantum vacuum Casimir effect, but arising from classical noise fluctuations.

        Key contributions include:
        - **Bidirectional soliton rain dynamics**: First experimental observation of soliton bunches exhibiting Casimir-like acceleration and bidirectional motion in fiber lasers (Physical Review Letters 2018).
        - **Bound soliton pairs**: Controlled dynamical transitions between loosely- and tightly-bound soliton states, explained by noise-mediated interaction potentials (Optica 2022).
        - **Ultrafast rogue waves**: Measurement and modeling of extreme wave events in fiber lasers using time-lens techniques (Optica 2018).
        - **Multimode fiber saturable absorbers**: Theory and experiments on bandwidth-induced saturation mechanisms (Optics Letters 2024).

        <h2 id="ai-for-science">AI for Science</h2>

        I explore how AI and photonics can accelerate each other. On one hand, I develop **optical and RF-based neural network architectures** that perform machine learning directly in the physical domain, achieving energy-efficient and ultra-fast inference. On the other hand, I apply AI methods to advance scientific discovery.

        Key contributions include:
        - **Disaggregated in-physics computing**: Machine learning executed directly in radio-frequency hardware, enabling AI at the wireless edge without digital processing (Science Advances 2026).
        - **Optical QAM neural networks**: Efficient optical AI accelerators using quadrature amplitude modulation.
        - **Nanophotonic integrators**: Three-terminal photonic devices for deep neural network computation.
