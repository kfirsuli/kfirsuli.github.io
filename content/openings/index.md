      title: Join My Lab at the Technion
      subtitle: Open Positions in Quantum Photonics, Secure AI, and Nonlinear Optics
      text: |
        I am building a new research group at the **Technion's Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical & Computer Engineering**. The lab will work at the intersection of quantum photonics, information-theoretically secure AI, and nonlinear optics.

        I am looking for curious, driven researchers to join me at all levels.

        ## Research Vision

        Our lab will tackle some of the most exciting challenges at the boundary of quantum physics, photonics, and artificial intelligence:

        - **Quantum communication systems** — designing and building next-generation QKD protocols and entangled photon sources
        - **Quantum-secure machine learning** — using quantum mechanics to guarantee privacy in cloud AI
        - **Optical and RF neural networks** — computing directly in the physical domain for energy-efficient AI
        - **Nonlinear photonics** — harnessing complex dynamics in fiber lasers and multimode systems

        We combine theory, numerical simulation, and hands-on experiments. If you enjoy working across disciplines and building things that work, this is the place for you.

        ## Open Positions

        ### PhD Students
        I am actively recruiting PhD students starting in 2026-2027. Ideal candidates have a strong background in one or more of:
        - Quantum optics / photonics
        - Machine learning / deep learning
        - Nonlinear dynamics / fiber optics
        - Physics or electrical engineering

        No prior research experience in all areas is needed — curiosity and willingness to learn are most important.

        ### Postdoctoral Researchers
        I am looking for postdocs with a PhD in physics, electrical engineering, or a related field. Experience in experimental quantum optics, optical computing, or quantum information is a plus.

        ### MSc Students
        Thesis-based MSc positions are available for Technion students interested in experimental or computational projects.

        ### Visiting Researchers
        I welcome short-term visitors and collaborators. Reach out to discuss possibilities.

        ## What I Look For

        - **Intellectual curiosity** — a genuine excitement about understanding how things work
        - **Technical strength** — solid foundation in physics, math, or engineering
        - **Independence and initiative** — ability to identify and pursue interesting questions
        - **Collaborative spirit** — willingness to work with others and share knowledge
        - **Resilience** — research involves setbacks; I value persistence and creative problem-solving

        ## What You Get

        - **Mentorship**: I am committed to your scientific growth and career development. We will work closely together, especially in your first year.
        - **Resources**: Access to state-of-the-art quantum optics and photonics equipment at the Technion.
        - **Collaboration network**: Active collaborations with MIT (Englund Lab), Hebrew University (Bromberg Lab), and other leading groups.
        - **Community**: The Technion's ECE faculty is a vibrant, world-class research environment. Haifa is a beautiful coastal city with a great quality of life.
        - **Funding**: Competitive fellowships and stipends. I will actively help you secure additional funding.

        ## How to Apply

        Send me an email at **kfir@mit.edu** with:

        1. **Your CV** (including publications, if any)
        2. **A brief research statement** (1-2 paragraphs): What excites you about this lab's research? What would you like to work on?
        3. **Transcripts** (unofficial is fine)
        4. **Names of 2-3 references** (for postdoc applications)

        Subject line: `[Lab Application] Your Name — Position (PhD/Postdoc/MSc)`

        I review applications on a rolling basis and will respond to every email.

        ## FAQ

        **When does the lab start?**
        The lab is expected to open in 2026. I am recruiting now so we can hit the ground running.

        **Do I need to speak Hebrew?**
        No. The lab language is English. The Technion is an international institution with many non-Hebrew-speaking students and postdocs.

        **Can I visit before applying?**
        Absolutely. If you are in Israel or passing through, I am happy to meet in person. Otherwise, let's set up a video call.

        **Is funding available?**
        Yes. PhD and postdoc positions come with competitive stipends. I also encourage and support applications for external fellowships (e.g., Azrieli, Zuckerman, VATAT).

        **I don't have a background in quantum — can I still apply?**
        Yes! Many successful quantum researchers come from adjacent fields (classical optics, ML, electrical engineering, math). What matters most is your ability and willingness to learn.
