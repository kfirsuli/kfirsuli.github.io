      subtitle: Open Positions at the Technion
      text: |
        I am building the **Quantum Machine Intelligence Lab** at the **Technion's Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical & Computer Engineering**.

        I am looking for curious, driven researchers to join me at all levels.

        ## Research Vision

        The lab will advance the second quantum revolution in the AI era — developing novel information-processing protocols and demonstrating them on physical platforms. Our experimental toolbox includes integrated photonics, fiber optics, analog electronics, and satellite-communication infrastructure, with a dual track: harvesting classical gains now while advancing the protocols and hardware needed for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

        - **Quantum-secure machine learning** — physics-based, information-theoretically secure computation for cloud AI
        - **In-physics computing** — optical and RF neural networks that perform ML directly in the physical domain
        - **Automated theorem proving** — formal verification of quantum protocols in Lean
        - **Quantum & nonlinear photonics** — soliton dynamics, photon-pair generation, coherent control, and integrated photonics

        We combine theory, numerical simulation, and hands-on experiments. If you enjoy working across disciplines and building things that work, this is the place for you.

        ## Open Positions

        ### PhD Students
        I am actively recruiting PhD students to start in 2027. Selected candidates can begin working with me immediately at MIT, or join the lab at the Technion when it opens. Ideal candidates have a strong background in one or more of:
        - Quantum optics / photonics
        - Machine learning / deep learning
        - Nonlinear dynamics / fiber optics
        - Physics or electrical engineering

        No prior research experience in all areas is needed — curiosity and willingness to learn are most important.

        ### Postdoctoral Researchers
        I am looking for postdocs with a PhD in physics, electrical engineering, or a related field. Positions are available immediately — you can start working with me at MIT or join the Technion lab when it opens. Experience in experimental quantum optics, optical computing, or quantum information is a plus.

        ### MSc Students
        Thesis-based MSc positions are available for Technion students interested in experimental or computational projects.

        ### Visiting Researchers
        I welcome short-term visitors and collaborators. Reach out to discuss possibilities.

        ## What I Look For

        - **Intellectual curiosity** — a genuine excitement about understanding how things work
        - **Technical strength** — solid foundation in physics, math, or engineering
        - **Independence and initiative** — ability to identify and pursue interesting questions
        - **Collaborative spirit** — willingness to work with others and share knowledge
        - **Resilience** — research involves setbacks; I value persistence and creative problem-solving

        ---

        ## What You Get

        - **Mentorship**: I am committed to your scientific growth and career development. We will work closely together, especially in your first year.
        - **Resources**: Access to state-of-the-art quantum optics and photonics equipment at the Technion.
        - **Collaboration network**: Active collaborations with MIT (Englund Lab), Hebrew University (Bromberg Lab), and other leading groups.
        - **Community**: The Technion's ECE faculty is a vibrant, world-class research environment. Haifa is a beautiful coastal city with a great quality of life.
        - **Funding**: Competitive fellowships and stipends. I will actively help you secure additional funding.

        ## How to Apply

        Send me an email at **kfir@mit.edu** with:

        1. **Your CV** (including publications, if any)
        2. **A brief research statement** (1-2 paragraphs): What excites you about this lab's research? What would you like to work on?
        3. **Transcripts** (unofficial is fine)
        4. **Names of 2-3 references** (for postdoc applications)

        Subject line: `[Lab Application] Your Name — Position (PhD/Postdoc/MSc)`

        I review applications on a rolling basis and will respond to every email.

        ## FAQ

        **When does the lab start?**
        The Technion lab is expected to open in 2027. I am recruiting now — selected candidates can start working with me immediately at MIT or join at the Technion.

        **Do I need to speak Hebrew?**
        No. The lab language is English. The Technion is an international institution with many non-Hebrew-speaking students and postdocs.

        **Can I visit before applying?**
        Absolutely. If you are in Israel or passing through, I am happy to meet in person. Otherwise, let's set up a video call.

        **Is funding available?**
        Yes. PhD and postdoc positions come with competitive stipends. I also encourage and support applications for external fellowships (e.g., Azrieli, Zuckerman, VATAT).

        **I don't have a background in quantum — can I still apply?**
        Yes! Many successful quantum researchers come from adjacent fields (classical optics, ML, electrical engineering, math). What matters most is your ability and willingness to learn.
