Profile
======
I am a passionate final year undergraduate studying physics and mathematics. My current research interests include quantum information, nonlinear optics and astrophysics. I am especially fascinated by the areas of physics in which theory is closely motivated by experiment. 

Education
======
* B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics 2019-present
  GPA: 4.0/4.0, first in the 2021 class of physics.

Research experience
======
* Summer 2019: Experimental Research Project in Nonlinear Optics - Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
  “Mode Locked Fiber Laser”
  * Built a mode locked laser.
  * Designed a numerical simulation in Python of laser mode locking using the Haus master equation.
* 2020-2021: Theoretical and Experimental Research Project in Nonlinear Optics - Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
    “Loosely and Tightly Bound Optical Soliton Steady States”
    * Experimentally measured and analytically calculated noise-mediated interactions of short light pulses.
    * Presented in group meetings.
* Summer 2021 - present: Theoretical Research Project in Astrophysics - Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
    * Taken part in analytical “toy modeling” of survival of giant clumps against disruption by supernova feedback.
    * Presented in group meetings.
