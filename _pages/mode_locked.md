A mode locked laser is a special type of laser which emits ultrashort light pulses, having temporal width ~ 1 picosecond. Since the temporal duration of the pulses is much shorter than the pulse frequency, the peak power of the laser can be orders of magnitude greater than its average power. The different temporal modes in the laser have identical phase resulting in a short intense pulse.

A key component in any mode locked laser is a saturable absorber. Saturable absorbers are nonlinear components which exhibit intensity discrimination, meaning their transmitance depends on the input intensity of the light.
