Hi, my name is Kfir Sulimany and I am a PhD candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

In 2014, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, as part of Talpiot Elite Training Academic Program. Shortly afterwards, I acquired an additional diploma in Computer Science from Israel’s Open University. For four years I served in the Israeli Intelligence corps in various leading R&D positions, where I headed numerous research projects under stiff operational constraints and strict deadlines. During my service, I managed to complete an MSc degree in Prof. Hadar Steinberg’s lab in solid state physics and published, in collaboration with Prof. Omri Gat and Prof. Moti Friedman, my first paper in Physical Review Letters in 2018. The paper published concerned nonlinear interactions in a mode-locked fiber laser that I built from scratch. Later, in collaboration with my colleague Offek Tziperman, I discovered the role of these interactions in bound soliton states.

During the years 2019-2020, I served in the Israeli Ministry of Defense's R&D Division (Mafa't; Israel’s DARPA equivalent). The project I mostly focused on was building the Israeli Quantum Key Distribution demonstrator. Part of my responsibilities included development in the areas of quantum optics, electro-optics, RF-electronics, algorithms, and quantum information. I was responsible for conducting security analysis against a quantum computer, where I collaborated with Prof. Michael Ben-Or. Recently, together with my colleague Rom Dudkiewicz, I introduced and implemented a novel security protocol which allows for superior performance and laid its security analysis with high dimensional quantum states.

Starting from 2017, I have been a PhD student in Prof. Yaron Bromberg’s lab at the Hebrew University, where I work on quantum information processing and quantum optics. My research, along with my colleagues Ohad Lib and Mamoon Safadi, is focused on experimental and theoretical quantum cryptography as well as generating complex photonic states for quantum technologies. Based on these states, I wish to demonstrate quantum communication protocols including teleportation, boson sampling and quantum simulations. Following my advancements in the field, I was the recipient of the Quantum Technology fellowship from the Israeli Council for Higher education (VATAT) in 2020.

In 2021, along with my colleagues Dror Liran, Alon Salhov and Zohar Nowik, I co-founded the Student Chapter of the HUJI Quantum Information Center with the purpose of growing the quantum information community at the university and beyond.
