Many galaxies at high redshift are clumpy, meaning they have areas that are overdense compared to the sorroundings. Clumps are formed when the force of gravitation overcomes the forces due to pressure and rotation causing a local inward collapse of mass. Below is a snapshot from a simulated galaxy in the Vela simulation suite (figure from Mandelker et al 17):
